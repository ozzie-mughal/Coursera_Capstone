    "Since the Sydney Lockout Laws Legislation was introduced in 2014, the night-time economy of Australia's most famous city has become an interesting subject of study. Enforcing 1.30AM lockouts and 3AM last drinks at bars, pubs, and clubs in Sydneys entertainment precincts (such as Kings Cross) to deter alcohol- and drug-fuelled violence, these businesses have suffered a decrease in trade and demand. Given pedestrian traffic dropped by 40% in Kings Cross, falling from a Saturday peak of 5,590 per hour between 1AM and 2AM in 2010, to a Saturday peak of 3,888 between 12AM and 1AM in 2015 (http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/feb/11/sydneys-lockout-laws-five-key-facts-about-the-citys-alcohol-debate), other night-time facility types, such as eateries, have a greater pressure to pick up the fall. A Deloitte Access Economics report, called ImagineSydney: Play, examines the cityâ€™s night-time economy is underperforming and losing $16bn, further stating 'a number of sectors would need to expand their night-time services, ranging from restaurants and bars to arts and culture, entertainment and fitness centres' (https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/sydney-is-losing-out-on-16-billion-a-year-due-to-an-underdeveloped-nighttime-economy/news-story/5fab6b8bd90e41bafdab5c7438ba2e3b).\n",
    "\n",
    "A greater demand for these other services creates an opportunity for increased market share. Investors, interested particularly in rising fads of international desserts such as bubble tea, can capitalise on the dynamic shift in Sydney's night-time activities by assessing the factors that have contributed to successful night-time restaurants/cafes. Indeed, factors such as parking space proximity and public transport accessibility are now critical to a eatery businesses success in light of the Lockout Laws and the decrease in accessibility of these facilities (eg. less frequent trains, more expensive parking during lockout period etc.)(https://www.thebalancesmb.com/choosing-restaurant-location-2888543). It is then critical that an investor is able to discern patterns in these details pertaining to existing night-time eateries, and apply this to predict the optimal decisions in setting up the business that consider it successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **business problem**, then, is defined as determining the ideal location(s) to set up a successful night-time eatery, based on factors including private/public transport accessibility, pre-existing successful eatery street locations, and general facility features (eg. Wi-Fi, outdoor seating etc.). Foursquare's location API services will be utilised to obtain late-night venue details, such as coordinates, ratings, and restaurant features, and investigate these details for patterns and grouping. The **stakeholder** of this business problem can be identified as an investor attempting to capitalise on a night-time economy shifting demand to more eateries, and opening a new eatery business utilising, for success, discerned patterns on the aforementioned factors."
